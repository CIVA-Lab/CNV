To get cornea detection

1. Put your raw images in a folder called input, the images should be placed as this example:

ex: input\Extreme\ET_101_Day 21_04.16.2015\image1.png

2. Run Main_cornea_data_preparation.m

This script will prepare your input for Mask R-CNN detection.

3. Setup Mask R-CNN using this website: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
Put the mosaic_cornea_weights in log, and put your Output\stage_test folder in the same folder with the nucleus example and run nucleus.py 

4. Take the detection masks and place them in 

Output/Output_from_MaskRCNN_masks

To treat the results generated from mask R-CNN by fitting a circle on mask R-CNN results, you should run 5, and the results will be ready in Output/Classify_me_circles folder for RF CNV Grading

5.fit_circles_to_maskrcnn_masks_results.m
 
This script uses Pratt method to fit the cicle
